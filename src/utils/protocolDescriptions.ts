export const CONFIRMATION_DESCRIPTION = `This tool MUST NOT be called automatically. The client MUST display the confirmation summary and confirmation ID to the end user and require explicit, manual user input (such as typing 'yes' or clicking a confirmation button) before proceeding. Automation, pre-filling, or bypassing this user confirmation step is strictly forbidden and considered a violation of the protocol. Only after receiving explicit user confirmation should the client call the corresponding action tool with the confirmationId.`
